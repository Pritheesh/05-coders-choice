## Proposed Project

Digital Signature

I would like to develop a console based application which implements a digital signature. 
Sender uses the services of the server to generate a digital signature and sends it to a receiver.
The receiver then uses the services of the server again and check for the integrity and authentication of the message received.




## Outline Structure

An application that stores/generates the keys for encryption and decryption. (acts like a CA)
Another application which acts as a server that uses the above application for keys and does the encryption, decryption and hashing
A sender and receiver use the server to generate digital signatures and check for integrity and authentication of message sent.
